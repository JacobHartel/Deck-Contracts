# Deck T Contracts
**This will be the contracts that mint the NFT collections. They will however only be done after 'shuffling the deck'**

## There are still a lot of things to iron out but the contracts won't be the revolutionary act here....yet

- **Creators**: this will be more centered around creators in the beginning. I want them to have the tools to create games, collectable cards, and maybe even contracts with brand, ips
- **Buyers**: Hopefully this protocol will be able to be housed on multiple platforms, negotiating splits I want volume not large percentages. I need my incentives aligned with the creators more than the buyers **in the early days
- **Rarity-Built-in**: I will have an algorithm, open sourced that will be in the api. This will be the shuffle, ensuring there is a limited number of the more rare cards ensuring they retain their value, hoping buyers will keep their items for the long haul.
- **Second Hand Trading**: This might be later in the game, but would like it up and running quickly so users who can't seem to get the whole deck can find a way to trade their way into their entire collection

# To-Do's 

- **Research**: Need to make sure I'm setting up the dynamic contracts correctly, research their interactions with IPFS
- **Complete Minting Contract**: Want to get this done by the end of next week. After building websites for Louis 
- **Research hosting for api/ipfs**: Need something fairly cheap but appreciated by the community (ETH/base...just for now to test out hypothesis)
- **Find Artist to Create Opening Deck**: Looks like I may need to get into some card deck creator forums or reddit/instagram/facebook groups? we'll figure it out
- **Start cold calling lesser known Manga creators**: Really need some reputable brands/ips to get this thing rolling. I know people have tried but "bet on it!"
